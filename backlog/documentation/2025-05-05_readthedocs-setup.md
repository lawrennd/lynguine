# Task: Set Up ReadTheDocs Integration

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_readthedocs-setup
- **Title**: Set Up ReadTheDocs Integration for Lynguine
- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: TBD
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: None (CIP-0002 local configuration is complete)

## Description

While the ReadTheDocs configuration file (.readthedocs.yml) has been created as part of CIP-0002, the project has not yet been registered on the ReadTheDocs platform. This task involves setting up the project on ReadTheDocs to enable hosted documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Register lynguine project on ReadTheDocs platform
- [ ] Connect the GitHub repository to ReadTheDocs
- [ ] Verify that documentation builds successfully on ReadTheDocs
- [ ] Add ReadTheDocs badge to the README.md
- [ ] Update CIP-0002 to mark ReadTheDocs integration as fully completed

## Implementation Notes

The ReadTheDocs configuration file already exists in the repository. The primary work will be on the ReadTheDocs platform to set up the project.

Steps to register on ReadTheDocs:
1. Create an account on ReadTheDocs (if needed)
2. Import the GitHub repository
3. Configure the build settings
4. Trigger an initial build

### 2025-05-05
