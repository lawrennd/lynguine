# Task: Implement Easy Installation Method for VibeSafe

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_easy-installation-method
- **Title**: Implement Easy Installation Method for VibeSafe
- **Status**: Ready
- **Priority**: High
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: lawrennd
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: CIP-0002

## Description

To make VibeSafe easy to adopt across projects, we need to develop simple installation scripts that work with minimal dependencies. This task involves implementing the installation methods proposed in CIP-0002.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create shell script (`install-vibesafe.sh`) for one-line installation
- [ ] Create Python script (`install_vibesafe.py`) as an alternative
- [ ] Support selective component installation (backlog, CIP, cursor rules)
- [ ] Test installation on different operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Support both new installations and updates to existing installations
- [ ] Add scripts to VibeSafe repository
- [ ] Update main README.md with installation instructions
- [ ] Create example documentation for different installation scenarios

## Implementation Notes

The installation scripts should be designed to work with minimal dependencies, preferring tools that are commonly available on development machines:

1. **Shell Script Requirements:**
   - Should work with bash (and possibly other shells)
   - Should have fallback mechanisms if certain tools are not available
   - Should handle errors gracefully with helpful messages

2. **Python Script Requirements:**
   - Should work with Python 3.6+
   - Should use only the standard library (no external dependencies)
   - Should provide the same functionality as the shell script

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Test on clean environments
   - Test on repositories with existing VibeSafe installations
   - Test with different configuration options

Task created based on CIP-0002 proposal. The CIP contains a draft implementation of the shell script that serves as a starting point.
