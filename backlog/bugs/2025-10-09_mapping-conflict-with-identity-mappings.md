# Task: Fix mapping conflict with identity mappings

## Description

When using `vstack` to combine data from multiple sources with an interface-level mapping, the system encounters a `ValueError` when trying to override auto-generated identity mappings.

**Error scenario:**
1. A vstack combines data from multiple sources where some have a column like `job_title` (which is a valid variable name)
2. `_augment_column_names()` auto-generates an identity mapping: `job_title -> job_title`
3. The interface specifies an explicit mapping: `jobTitle: job_title`
4. When `update_name_column_map()` tries to apply the interface mapping, it raises:
   ```
   ValueError: Column "job_title" already exists in the name-column map and there's an attempt 
   to update its value to "jobTitle" when it's original value was "job_title" and that would 
   lead to unexpected behaviours.
   ```

**Root cause:**
The `update_name_column_map()` method recognizes camelCase auto-generated mappings (like `jobTitle` for `job title`) as overridable, but doesn't recognize identity mappings (like `job_title -> job_title`) as auto-generated, even though they are created automatically by `_augment_column_names()` when a column name is already a valid variable name.

**Example configuration that triggers the bug:**
```yaml
input:
  type: vstack
  index: Name
  mapping:
    givenName: given
    jobTitle: job_title  # Conflicts with auto-generated job_title -> job_title
  specifications:
  - type: markdown_directory
    source:
      - glob: "*.md"
        directory: /some/path/with/job_title/column/
  - type: yaml
    filename: data.yaml  # May or may not have job_title column
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Interface mappings can override auto-generated identity mappings without raising ValueError
- [ ] The fix recognizes both types of auto-generated mappings:
  - [ ] Identity mappings: `column -> column` (for valid variable names)
  - [ ] CamelCase mappings: `camelCase -> column name` (for invalid variable names)
- [ ] Existing behavior for non-auto-generated mapping conflicts is preserved
- [ ] Test case added to verify the fix
- [ ] User's actual data (`~/OneDrive/referia/people/`) loads successfully

## Implementation Notes

**Solution:**
Modify the `update_name_column_map()` method in `lynguine/assess/data.py` to recognize identity mappings as auto-generated.

**Code change in `update_name_column_map()` (around line 3074):**
```python
# Before:
if original_name == auto_generated_name:
    # Allow overwriting auto-generated camelCase mappings

# After:
if original_name == auto_generated_name or original_name == column:
    # Allow overwriting both camelCase and identity auto-generated mappings
```

This simple change allows the system to recognize that when `original_name == column` (identity mapping), it's an auto-generated mapping that can be safely overridden by an explicit interface mapping.

**Why this works:**
- `_augment_column_names()` creates identity mappings for columns with valid variable names
- These are just as "auto-generated" as camelCase mappings
- Interface-level mappings should take precedence over any auto-generated mappings
- Non-auto-generated conflicts (where two different explicit names map to the same column) should still raise an error

## Progress Updates

### 2025-10-09

Bug identified when loading `~/OneDrive/referia/people/_referia.yml` with vstack containing multiple sources and `jobTitle: job_title` mapping in the interface. Solution identified and implemented: recognize identity mappings as auto-generated by checking if `original_name == column` in addition to checking if `original_name == auto_generated_name`.
