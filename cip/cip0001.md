# CIP-0001: Documentation and Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Status

- [x] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [x] Implemented
- [x] Closed

## Description

This CIP outlines a comprehensive plan to improve documentation and test coverage across the lynguine project.

## Motivation

The project needed improved documentation and test coverage to:
1. Make the codebase more maintainable
2. Ensure compatibility with newer versions of dependencies
3. Provide better onboarding experience for new contributors
4. Increase reliability through comprehensive testing

## Implementation

The plan addresses four main areas:

1. **Documentation Build System**
   - Add Sphinx and related dependencies to poetry
   - Correct module names throughout documentation
   - Ensure proper configuration in conf.py

2. **Module Documentation**
   - Update .rst files with meaningful module overviews
   - Add examples and usage patterns
   - Include architecture diagrams
   - Create proper index structure

3. **Code Docstrings**
   - Improve docstrings across key modules
   - Add parameter annotations, return types, and exceptions documentation

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Run coverage analysis to identify gaps
   - Target key modules for improvement
   - Implement comprehensive tests for critical functions
   - Fix compatibility issues

## Implementation Status
- [x] Fix Documentation Build System
- [x] Enhance Module Documentation
- [x] Improve Code Docstrings
- [x] Test Coverage Analysis
- [x] Improve test coverage for priority modules
- [x] Fix Compatibility Issues with NumPy/Pandas

## Progress Log

### 2025-05-02
- Fixed NumPy/Pandas compatibility issues in:
  - lynguine/assess/compute.py: Updated DataFrame indexing
  - lynguine/assess/data.py: Fixed _NoValueType errors
  - Updated utility functions in dataframe.py
  - All tests now pass with newer NumPy/Pandas versions

- Added comprehensive tests for lynguine/util/html.py, increasing coverage from 29% to 100%
- Added comprehensive tests for lynguine/util/yaml.py, increasing coverage from 61% to 100%
- Fixed and improved tests for lynguine/assess/compute.py
- Created extended test files for complex modules
- Verified test coverage metrics and resolved compatibility issues

## Results

The implementation resulted in:
- Documentation that builds successfully with modern dependencies
- Improved docstrings across key modules
- Test coverage improvements:
  - lynguine/util/html.py: 29% → 100%
  - lynguine/assess/compute.py: 51% → 62%
  - lynguine/config/interface.py: 56% → 61%
  - lynguine/util/yaml.py: 61% → 100%
- All 472 tests now pass successfully with current NumPy and Pandas versions
