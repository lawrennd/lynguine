# CIP-0002: Standardized Documentation Compilation

## Status

- [x] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [x] Implemented
- [ ] Closed

## Description

This CIP proposes to standardize documentation compilation between lynguine and referia, adopting the more modern approach currently used in referia.

## Motivation

Currently, referia uses Poetry with dedicated documentation groups, ReadTheDocs integration, documentation testing, and advanced Sphinx extensions. Standardizing these approaches will:

1. Simplify maintenance across both projects
2. Ensure consistent documentation quality and appearance
3. Make it easier for contributors to work across both repositories
4. Provide better visualization of class hierarchies and relationships

## Implementation

The following changes are proposed:

1. **Update Dependency Management**
   - Use Poetry with a dedicated `docs` group instead of dev-dependencies
   - Install documentation dependencies using Poetry in GitHub Actions

2. **Add Documentation Testing**
   - Add a test script to verify documentation builds without errors
   - Run this test in CI/CD before building the documentation

3. **Enhance Documentation Features**
   - Add inheritance diagram support using Sphinx extensions
   - Configure default autodoc settings for consistent class documentation

4. **Add ReadTheDocs Support**
   - Add a standard ReadTheDocs configuration file
   - Ensure documentation can be built on ReadTheDocs platform

## Implementation Status
- [x] Update dependency management with Poetry docs group
- [x] Add documentation testing
- [x] Add inheritance diagram support
- [x] Configure ReadTheDocs integration
