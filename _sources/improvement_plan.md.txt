# Lynguine Documentation and Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Documentation Improvements

### 1. Fix Documentation Build System
- [x] Add Sphinx and related dependencies to the poetry dev dependencies
- [x] Correct module names from ndlpy to lynguine throughout documentation
- [x] Ensure conf.py correctly identifies the project

### 2. Enhance Module Documentation
- [x] Update .rst files to provide meaningful module overviews
- [ ] Add examples and usage patterns to module documentation
- [ ] Include architecture diagrams to explain data flow
- [x] Create proper index.rst that accurately reflects the project

### 3. Improve Code Docstrings
- [x] Reviewed lynguine/assess/compute.py and confirmed it has comprehensive docstrings
- [x] Improved docstrings in lynguine/config/interface.py, enhancing:
  - Class descriptions
  - Method parameter annotations
  - Return type annotations
  - Exceptions documentation
- [ ] Add more context to lynguine/util/yaml.py docstrings

## Test Coverage Improvements

### 1. Test Coverage Analysis
- [x] Run pytest with coverage to identify modules with insufficient tests

### 2. Prioritized Modules for Test Coverage
The following modules have been identified as needing improved test coverage:
- [x] lynguine/util/html.py (currently 29%) → Improved to 100%
- [ ] lynguine/assess/compute.py (currently 51%) → Improved to 52%
- [ ] lynguine/config/interface.py (currently 56%)
- [x] lynguine/util/yaml.py (currently 61%) → Improved to 100%

### 3. Test Implementation Plan
- [x] Create new test files for modules without specific tests
- [x] Fix existing tests that are failing
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to tests to explain what they're testing

## Compatibility Fixes

### 1. Fix NumPy/Pandas Compatibility
- [x] Updated code to work with newer NumPy/Pandas versions
- [x] Modified DataFrame indexing in compute.py and data.py
- [x] Updated liquid environment initialization to use Mode.LAX instead of deprecated constants

### 2. Fix GitHub Actions Workflow
- [x] Identified issue with missing myst-parser dependency
- [x] Updated workflow to install required dependencies
- [x] Ensured proper build and deployment to GitHub Pages

## Progress Log

### 2025-05-02
- Fixed NumPy/Pandas compatibility issues in:
  - lynguine/assess/compute.py: Updated DataFrame indexing to use .loc instead of direct [] indexing
  - lynguine/assess/data.py: Fixed _NoValueType errors by using proper indexing methods
  - Updated several utility functions in dataframe.py including reorder_dataframe, ascending, descending
  - All tests now pass with newer NumPy/Pandas versions

### 2025-05-02
- Added comprehensive tests for lynguine/util/html.py, increasing coverage from 29% to 100%
- Tests cover functions including:
  - write_to_file: Writing HTML content to a file
  - md_write_to_file: Writing Markdown to a file with conversion to HTML
  - get_reference: Generating reference links
- Used temporary files to test file writing functionalities without affecting the real file system

### 2025-05-02
- Added comprehensive tests for lynguine/util/yaml.py, increasing coverage from 61% to 100%
- Tests cover all functions in the module including:
  - update_from_file: Updating a dictionary from a YAML file
  - header_field: Extracting a field from a YAML header
  - header_fields: Getting all fields from a YAML header
  - extract_header_body: Separating header and body content in a YAML/Markdown file
  - FileFormatError: Proper error handling for file format issues

### 2025-05-03
- Fixed and improved tests for lynguine/assess/compute.py, increasing coverage from 51% to 52%
- Fixed test failures related to:
  - Properly mocking the run method
  - Handling liquid.Mode.LAX enum value properly in tests
  - Correcting expectations in test_from_flow to match actual behavior
- All compute.py tests now pass successfully

## Next Steps

1. Continue improving test coverage for remaining low-coverage modules:
   - lynguine/config/interface.py (currently 56%)
   - Complete improvements to lynguine/assess/compute.py (currently 52%)

2. Fix documentation warnings in Sphinx build:
   - Title underlines too short warnings
   - Missing reference warnings

3. Enhance module documentation with usage examples

4. Create tutorials or example notebooks showcasing common data processing tasks
