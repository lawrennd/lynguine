How Can I Contribute?
---------------------

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before submitting a bug report, please check that it hasn't already been reported. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Suggesting Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as GitHub issues. When you are creating an enhancement issue, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the proposed feature.
- An explanation of why this enhancement would be useful to most ndlpy users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community extension.

Your First Code Contribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unsure where to begin contributing to ndlpy? You can start by looking through the 'beginner' and 'help-wanted' issues:

- Beginner Issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help Wanted Issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain ndlpy's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible ndlpy
- Enable a sustainable system for ndlpy's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the `style guides`_
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all `status checks`_ are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
